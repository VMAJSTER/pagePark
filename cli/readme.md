# PagePark command line tool

Run this from the command line to communicate directly with the copy of PagePark running on the same machine. It allows you to list processes, stop and restart them, and possibly other things in the future. Patterened after the command line interface of Forever, which is included in PagePark. 

For more info on processes see the docs for persistent apps.
